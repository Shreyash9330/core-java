String – Java 

A String in Java is a sequence of characters used to store and handle text.
Strings in Java are objects of the String class, and they are widely used in all applications — from user input to data processing.

⭐ 1. Strings are Immutable

Once a string is created, its value cannot be changed.

Example:

String s = "Hello";
s = "World";


Here, "Hello" is not modified.
Java creates a new String object "World".

This is called immutability.

⭐ 2. Stored in String Constant Pool

Strings are stored in a special memory area called the String Constant Pool, which helps:

save memory

reuse already existing string objects

⭐ 3. Ways to Create Strings
✔ Using String literal (recommended)
String s = "Java";

✔ Using new keyword
String s = new String("Java");

⭐ 4. Common String Methods

Some useful String operations:

Method	Purpose
length()	Returns number of characters
charAt(i)	Returns character at index
equals()	Compares string content
equalsIgnoreCase()	Compare ignoring case
toUpperCase()	Convert to upper case
toLowerCase()	Convert to lower case
substring()	Extract part of string
concat()	Join two strings
contains()	Check if substring exists
⭐ 5. String Comparison

Two types:

✔ .equals() → compares values
✔ == → compares references (memory)
⭐ 6. Mutable Alternatives

If you want changeable strings, use:

StringBuilder

StringBuffer

They allow modification without creating new objects.

⭐ 7. Real-World Use

Strings are used for:

user inputs

names, emails, city, address

file paths

website URLs

messages, text processing

Strings are one of the most used data types in Java.
