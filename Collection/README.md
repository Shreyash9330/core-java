# 🌟 Java Collections Framework – Core Java

The Java Collections Framework is a powerful architecture for storing, managing, and manipulating groups of objects.
It provides ready-made data structures such as List, Set, and Map to handle data efficiently.
Using collections improves performance, code readability, and scalability in real-world Java applications.
This module focuses on practical examples to build a strong Core Java foundation.
