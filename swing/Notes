Swing – Java 

Swing is a part of Java used to create GUI (Graphical User Interface) applications.
It provides a rich set of lightweight, flexible, and platform-independent components for building desktop applications.

Swing is part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) and is built on top of AWT, but provides more powerful and customizable components.
